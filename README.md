This Python script efficiently handles the renaming of files in a specified folder, automating the process based on extracted student IDs and corresponding project names from an Excel file.

1. **Extracting Data from Files:**
   - Extract data from each file, focusing on the first 10 lines to locate an 8-digit student ID.

2. **Matching Student IDs with Project Names:**
   - Matches extracted student IDs with project names from the Excel file, searching within the designated (student ID) column.

3. **Renaming Files:**
   - Renames  files using the student ID and project name. Handles scenarios where multiple students collaborate on a project by appending a counter for uniqueness.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Incorporates robust error handling to manage cases of non-numeric characters in extracted data and instances where no project name corresponds to a student ID.

5. **Example Usage:**
   - Users specify folder and Excel file paths. Upon execution, the script efficiently iterates through each file, extracting student IDs, matching them with project names, and renaming files accordingly.
